  abstract = {Accurate prediction of the functional impact of missense variants is important for disease gene discovery, clinical genetic diagnostics, therapeutic strategies, and protein engineering. Previous efforts have focused on predicting a binary pathogenicity classification, but the functional impact of missense variants is multi-dimensional. Pathogenic missense variants in the same gene may act through different modes of action (i.e., gain/loss-of-function) by affecting different aspects of protein function. They may result in distinct clinical conditions that require different treatments. We develop a new method, PreMode, to perform gene-specific mode-of-action predictions. PreMode models effects of coding sequence variants using SE(3)-equivariant graph neural networks on protein sequences and structures. Using the largest-to-date set of missense variants with known modes of action, we show that PreMode reaches state-of-the-art performance in multiple types of mode-of-action predictions by efficient transfer-learning. Additionally, PreMode's prediction of G/LoF variants in a kinase is consistent with inactive-active conformation transition energy changes. Finally, we show that PreMode enables efficient study design of deep mutational scans and can be expanded to fitness optimization of non-human proteins with active learning.},

Here, we introduce Smoother, a unified framework that integrates positional information into non-spatial models via modular priors and losses. In simulated and real datasets, Smoother enables accurate data imputation, cell-type deconvolution, and dimensionality reduction with remarkable efficiency. In colorectal cancer, Smoother-guided deconvolution reveals plasma cell and fibroblast subtype localizations linked to tumor microenvironment restructuring. Additionally, joint modeling of spatial and single-cell human prostate data with Smoother allows for spatial mapping of reference populations with significantly reduced ambiguity.},

  abstract = {Accurately predicting the effect of missense variants is important in discovering disease risk genes and clinical genetic diagnostics. Commonly used computational methods predict pathogenicity, which does not capture the quantitative impact on fitness in humans. We develop a method, MisFit, to estimate missense fitness effect using a graphical model. MisFit jointly models the effect at a molecular level ( d ) and a population level (selection coefficient, s ), assuming that in the same gene, missense variants with similar d have similar s . We train it by maximizing probability of observed allele counts in 236,017 individuals of European ancestry. We show that s is informative in predicting allele frequency across ancestries and consistent with the fraction of de novo mutations in sites under strong selection. Further, s outperforms previous methods in prioritizing de novo missense variants in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. In conclusion, MisFit accurately predicts s and yields new insights from genomic data.},

  abstract = {Rare or de novo variants have substantial contribution to human diseases, but the statistical power to identify risk genes by rare variants is generally low due to rarity of genotype data. Previous studies have shown that risk genes usually have high expression in relevant cell types, although for many conditions the identity of these cell types are largely unknown. Recent efforts in single cell atlas in human and model organisms produced large amount of gene expression data. Here we present VBASS, a Bayesian method that integrates single-cell expression and de novo variant (DNV) data to improve power of disease risk gene discovery. VBASS models disease risk prior as a function of expression profiles, approximated by deep neural networks. It learns the weights of neural networks and parameters of Gamma-Poisson likelihood models of DNV counts jointly from expression and genetics data. On simulated data, VBASS shows proper error rate control and better power than state-of-the-art methods. We applied VBASS to published datasets and identified more candidate risk genes with supports from literature or data from independent cohorts. VBASS can be generalized to integrate other types of functional genomics data in statistical genetics analysis.},

  abstract = {Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a collection of anatomically and clinically heterogeneous structure anomalies of heart at birth. Finding genetic causes of CHD can not only shed light on developmental biology of heart, but also provide basis for improving clinical care and interventions. The optimal study design and analytical approaches to identify genetic causes depend on the underlying genetic architecture. A few well-known syndromes with CHD as core conditions, such as Noonan and CHARGE, have known monogenic causes. The genetic causes of most of CHD patients, however, are unknown and likely to be complex. In this review, we highlight recent studies that assume a complex genetic architecture of CHD with two main approaches. One is genomic sequencing studies aiming for identifying rare or de novo risk variants with large genetic effect. The other is genome-wide association studies optimized for common variants with moderate genetic effect.},

Previous studies indicate that rare or de novo genetic variants significantly contribute to EA/TEF risk, and most individuals with EA/TEF do not have pathogenic genetic variants in established risk genes. To identify novel genetic contributions to EA/TEF, we performed whole genome sequencing of 185 trios (probands and parents) with EA/TEF, including 59 isolated and 126 complex cases with additional congenital anomalies and/or neurodevelopmental disorders. There was a significant burden of protein altering de novo coding variants in complex cases (p=3.3e-4), especially in genes that are intolerant of loss of function variants in the population. We performed simulation analysis of pathway enrichment based on background mutation rate and identified a number of pathways related to endocytosis and intracellular trafficking that as a group have a significant burden of protein altering de novo variants. We assessed 18 variants for disease causality using CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in Xenopus and confirmed 13 with tracheoesophageal phenotypes. Our results implicate disruption of endosome-mediated epithelial remodeling as a potential mechanism of foregut developmental defects. This research may have implications for the mechanisms of other rare congenital anomalies.},

  abstract = {The trachea and esophagus (TE) arise from a common foregut tube during embryonic development. Disruptions in TE morphogenesis cause congenital trachea-esophageal defects (TEDs) such as esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula and tracheoesophageal clefts. TEDs occur in approximately 1 in 3500 births, but their etiology is poorly understood. We have established the www.CLEARconsortium.org; a multidisciplinary team of clinicians, geneticists, bioinformaticians, stem cell and developmental biologists using patient genome sequencing, animal models and iPSC-derived human organoids to discover the genetic and developmental basis of trachea-esophageal birth defects. Using the complementary advantages of Xenopus and mouse models we have defined the conserved molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate normal TE morphogenesis. We show that downstream of Hedgehog/Gli signaling endosome-mediated epithelial remodeling regulates TE morphogenesis which when disrupted results in tracheoesophageal clefts similar to human Pallister Hall syndrome patients. Proband-parent trio genome sequencing identified an enrichment of potential damaging de novo variants in genes encoding membrane/vesicular-trafficking proteins, suggesting a common "endosome-opathy" pathway. Ongoing CRISPR mutagenesis screens in Xenopus tropicalis assessing candidate causative variants from patients confirms that the endosome protein Itsn1 is essential for TE morphogenesis, suggesting that the ITSN1 variant is likely pathogenic in the patient. Finally, leveraging results from animal models we have generated multi-lineage human esophageal organoids from iPSCs with patient mutations to identify how mutations impact human esophageal differentiation. Together these results significantly advance our understanding of TEDs with the goal of revealing phenotype-genotype associations that will inform prognosis and clinical treatment.},

  abstract = {Liver malignancies are among the tumor types that are resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition therapy. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly enriched and play a major role in inducing immunosuppression in liver malignancies. Herein, CCL2 and CCL5 are screened as two major chemokines responsible for attracting TAM infiltration and inducing their polarization toward cancer-promoting M2-phenotype. To reverse this immunosuppressive process, an innovative single-domain antibody that bispecifically binds and neutralizes CCL2 and CCL5 (BisCCL2/5i) with high potency and specificity is directly evolved. mRNA encoding BisCCL2/5i is encapsulated in a clinically approved lipid nanoparticle platform, resulting in a liver-homing biomaterial that allows transient yet efficient expression of BisCCL2/5i in the diseased organ in a multiple dosage manner. This BisCCL2/5i mRNA nanoplatform significantly induces the polarization of TAMs toward the antitumoral M1 phenotype and reduces immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. The combination of BisCCL2/5i with PD-1 ligand inhibitor (PD-Li) achieves long-term survival in mouse models of primary liver cancer and liver metastasis of colorectal and pancreatic cancers. The work provides an effective bispecific targeting strategy that could broaden the PD-Li therapy to multiple types of malignancies in the human liver.},

We show that CSOmap can successfully recapitulate the spatial organization of multiple organs of human and mouse including tumor microenvironments for multiple cancers in pseudo-space, and reveal molecular determinants of cellular interactions. Further, CSOmap readily simulates perturbation of genes or cell types to gain novel biological insights, especially into how immune cells interact in the tumor microenvironment. CSOmap can be a widely applicable tool to interrogate cellular organizations based on scRNA-seq data for various tissues in diverse systems.},

A cluster of LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) appeared to be the mature form of conventional DCs and possessed the potential to migrate from tumors to LNs. LAMP3+ DCs also expressed diverse immune-relevant ligands and exhibited potential to regulate multiple subtypes of lymphocytes. Of the macrophages in tumors that exhibited distinct transcriptional states, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were associated with poor prognosis, and we established the inflammatory role of SLC40A1 and GPNMB in these cells. Further, myeloid and lymphoid cells in ascites were predominantly linked to tumor and blood origins, respectively.
