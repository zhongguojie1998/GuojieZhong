I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in <a href='https://renlab.sdsc.edu/renlab_website/'>Dr. Bing Ren's lab</a> at the <a href='https://www.nygenome.org'>New York Genome Center</a>. 

Previously, I had the honor of completing my PhD under the guidance of <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411/'>Dr. Yufeng Shen</a> at the <a href='https://systemsbiology.columbia.edu'>Department of Systems Biology</a>, Columbia University. 

My research is driven by the ultimate goal to bridge the gap between complex human diseases and effective treatments. To achieve this, I develop biologically-inspired machine learning algorithms that can be applied to high-throughput genomics data to uncover disease mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. 

My current research interests include:
1.      Building DNA sequence-to-function foundation models that predict cell-type-specific transcriptional regulatory grammar in the human brain.
2.      Neuropsychological disease mechanism discovery utilizing a combination of high-throughput screening techniques and deep learning.
3.      Generative deep learning models for synthetic regulatory element design.

My past work has spanned several areas including:
1.      Single-cell spatial transcriptomics and cancer immunology: <a href='https://zhongguojie1998.github.io/GuojieZhong/projects/1_CSOmap/'>CSOmap</a>, <a href='https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31119-5'>Hepatocellular Carcinoma</a>
2.      Statistical genetics and developmental disorders: <a href='https://zhongguojie1998.github.io/GuojieZhong/projects/2_VBASS/'>VBASS</a>, <a href='https://www.cell.com/hgg-advances/fulltext/S2666-2477(22)00023-9?uuid=uuid%3Aa4c91d44-3860-43d2-a9da-94f084045bbd'>EA/TEF</a>
3.      Missense variant effect predictions: <a href='https://zhongguojie1998.github.io/GuojieZhong/projects/4_PreMode/'>PreMode</a>, <a href='https://zhongguojie1998.github.io/GuojieZhong/projects/3_RESCVE/'>RESCVE</a>, <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-59937-2'>MisFit</a>

Prior to Columbia, I earned my B.S. in the <a href='http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/cqben/'>Integrated Science Program</a> at Peking University with training primarily in biology, statistics, and computer science. I was privileged to work in <a href='http://cancer-pku.cn'>Dr. Zemin Zhang's Lab</a> for my undergraduate thesis on developing computational methods to infer cellular spatial organization and cellular interactions from single-cell genomics data.

In my free time, I enjoy playing fingerstyle guitar and badminton, both of which require a balance of power and control.
