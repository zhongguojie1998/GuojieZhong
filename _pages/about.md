I am currently a PhD student in <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411/'>Dr. Yufeng Shen’s lab</a> at Department of Systems Biology, Columbia University. My current research interests involve different topics regarding to human genetics of developmental disorders, including:
1.      Developing statistical learning methods that leverage large-scale exome sequencing and single cell sequencing data to understand human disease genetics.
2.      Developing machine learning tools to predict variant functional effects using representations of protein sequence, structure, and functions.
3.      Cross-disease genetics of several developmental disorders including autism, congenital heart disease, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, etc.

I am always facinated by the application of novel machine learning algorithms to biological questions, especially in the genetics and genomics of human disease. These days I am exploring Bayesian Graphical models, Variational Autoencoders, Transformer based protein language models.

Prior to Columbia, I got my B.S. in <a href='http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/cqben/'>Integrated Science Program</a> at Peking University with training mostly in biology, statistics and computer science. I joined <a href='http://cancer-pku.cn'>Dr. Zemin Zhang’s Lab</a> for my undergraduate thesis on developing computational methods to infer cellular spatial organization and cellular interaction from single cell genomics data.

I enjoy playing fingerstyle guitar and badminton in my free time, which both require a balance of power and  control.
