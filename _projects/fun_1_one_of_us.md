This is my first finguerstyle guitar video. Made in my senior year at Yuanpei College, Peking University. At that time I have been playing fingerstyle guitar for 3 years and I think maybe I need to make some videos to track my progress. I found this amazing music room in the basement of our student dormitory perfect for recording. This song is called One of Us. I was facinated by Sungha Jung's cover the first time I heard it and made it to be my first recording. Hope you enjoy it!
